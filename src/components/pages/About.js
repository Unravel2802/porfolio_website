                Hi, I'm Hoang, a computer enthusiast from Hanoi, Vietnam.
                I'm passionate about applying Machine Learning in fields like medicine and education.
                My experience at VNPT Technology and FPT Information System has equipped me with skills in
                full-stack web development and real-world ML applications. Currently, I'm a junior at the
                University of Massachusetts Amherst.
