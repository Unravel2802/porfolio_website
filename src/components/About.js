            <p>
                My name is Hoang, a computer enthusiast from Hanoi, Vietnam. I am interested in developing end-to-end solutions/applications
                that apply Machine Learning into other fields like medical or education. Working in
                VNPT Technology and FPT Information System have provided me the experience to build
                full-stack web applications as well as applying my Machine Learning knowledge to the
                real world. I am currently a junior at University of Massachusetts at Amherst, majoring
                in computer science and mathematics (data science concentration).
